# IFA Tablet tracker


A mini project, that will be helpful to keep a track of the IFA tablets consumed by the children in rural India. 
This project was done under The Akshaya Patra foundation internship.


The IFA tablet tracker is a web based application, which is used by teachers to enter the tablet intake of a student. It can be used in any web based platform and can be hosted on any web server without any major changes to code. The entire project can be shifted to a cloud platform when more functionalities are introduced, without much changes.
We have used some major technologies:

Backend:
●	Python
●	Flask
●	MySQL


Frontend:
●	HTML
●	CSS
